Place your certificate images in this folder.

Recommended:
- Use clear, high-resolution images (PNG or JPG).
- Aim for landscape aspect ratio where possible (e.g., 800x550).
- Keep filenames stable so code references do not need changes.

Default filenames used by the site:
- meta-buying-cert.svg (replace with your Meta certificate image)
- google-ads-cert.svg (replace with your Google Ads certificate image)

You can replace these placeholder SVGs with PNG/JPG files while keeping the same filenames and extensions, or update their paths in `src/app/page.tsx` accordingly.

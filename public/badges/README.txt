Add your badge images in this folder.

Expected filenames used in code (you can keep these or update the paths in code):
- meta-buyer-badge.png          (Meta Certified Media Buying Professional)
- meta-performance-badge.png    (Meta Performance Marketing Specialist)
- google-partner-badge.png      (Google Partner – in progress)

Tips
- Prefer transparent PNG or SVG, ~48–64px height looks good.
- Keep file sizes small (<100KB) for faster load.
- If you use different names, update the `src` values in `src/app/page.tsx` accordingly.
